# SKIMLIT Project

SkimLit is a natural language processing (NLP) project aimed at making the reading of medical abstracts more accessible. This project replicates the methodology outlined in the paper "PubMed 200K RCT: a Dataset for Sequenctial Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts," using TensorFlow and various deep learning techniques.

The primary aim of SKIMLIT is to classify different parts of academic publications' abstracts into specific categories. This can be particularly useful for researchers, students, or anyone interested in quickly understanding the key components of a scientific paper without having to read the entire document.

Dataset is available over here: https://github.com/Franck-Dernoncourt/pubmed-rct

The dataset consists of approximately 200,000 abstracts of randomized controlled trials, totaling 2.3 million sentences. Each sentence of each abstract is labeled with their role in the abstract using one of the following classes: background, objective, method, result, or conclusion.
